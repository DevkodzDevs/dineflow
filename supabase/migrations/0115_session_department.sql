-- 0115 · the session carries the person's department and position (2026-10-18)
-- session_bundle's profile had eight fields and no department, so a worker's phone could never match a job raised for
-- their department (0113's alerts) and the phone bar could not follow it. The same function, two more fields. Same grants.
