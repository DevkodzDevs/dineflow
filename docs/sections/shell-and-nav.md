# The shell — layout, nav and module gating

**Files** `app/(app)/layout.tsx` · `components/shell/Nav.tsx` · `TopBar.tsx` · `PageHeader.tsx` ·
`MasterBanner.tsx` · `FlipRow.tsx` · `packages/shared/src/constants.ts`
**Also** `components/ui/Theme.tsx` · `components/assist/**` · `components/ErrorRecovery.tsx` ·
`components/ServiceWorker.tsx`

## What it is

Everything around the page: the sidebar, the search bar, the theme switch, the bell, the Assist
panel, the master banner, and the rule that decides which screens a person can see at all.

## How it works

### Module gating — one function, four filters

```ts
modulesFor(type, role, enabled, allowed) =
    MODULES_BY_TYPE[type]          // does this kind of property have the screen?
  ∩ ROLE_ACCESS[role]              // may this role ever see it?
  ∩ (enabled ?? all) ∪ ALWAYS_ON   // has the master switched it on for this property?
  ∩ (allowed ?? ROLE_DEFAULT[role]) // did the owner leave the tick? (owner: everything)
                                    // dashboard is always granted
```

All four live in `packages/shared/src/constants.ts` so the web app and the mobile app agree. The
sidebar renders exactly what this returns.

`ROUTE_MODULE` in `app/(app)/layout.tsx` maps the first path segment to a module key and enforces
the same rule on the server, so a locked screen cannot be reached by typing its URL. A segment not
in that map is open to every signed-in person (e.g. `/membership`).

### There is deliberately no `loading.tsx`

Adding one next to `app/(app)/layout.tsx` makes **every screen in the app feel two and a half times
slower**, and it looks like an improvement while it does it.

React throttles how quickly a Suspense fallback may be replaced: once a skeleton has been shown it
stays for roughly 300 ms, so nobody sees it flash. That is right for a fallback that appears because
something is slow, and exactly wrong here, where it appears because something is fast. Measured,
moving between screens: **with the skeleton 331–348 ms; without it 74–131 ms** — the data was on the
device at ~110 ms and the screen did not change until ~330.

The tap is still acknowledged instantly: `<NavProgress>` in the root layout starts a bar on the
click itself, and the previous screen stays up rather than being replaced by a grey imitation of the
next one. **If one route is ever slow enough to need more, give that route its own `loading.tsx`.
Never give one to all of them.**

### The sidebar at each width

| Width | Menu |
| --- | --- |
| < 768 | no sidebar; `BottomNav`, a scrolling bar of icons and labels |
| 768–1279 (every iPad, both orientations, and tablets) | a 76px **icon rail** with a **hamburger** on top |
| ≥ 1280 | the full 256px menu, always out; no hamburger |

The hamburger opens the whole menu as a **drawer over the page**: `Sidebar` holds `open`, the aside
gets `data-open`, and CSS (globals.css, "the sidebar" block) makes it `position: fixed` at its own
spot and 272px wide. `.nav-spacer` — the element right after the aside — keeps the rail's 76px in
the row so the page underneath does not move; `.nav-scrim` takes the click that closes it. It also
closes on Escape, on picking a screen (the `path` effect), and if the window grows past 1279.
Every link carries `title={label}`, so the rail's icons name themselves on hover.

### The rest of the shell

- **`TopBar`** — search, theme switch, the bell (count comes from `session.lateKots`, already in
  the session bundle — no second query), the avatar.
- **`MasterBanner`** — the amber "viewing X as its owner" strip when a master is acting as a
  property. Everything done under it is real and logged.
- **`PageHeader`** — the title block each screen passes its own copy into.
- **`Theme`** — writes `data-theme` on `<html>`; `THEME_BOOT` runs inside `<head>` from the
  `df-theme` cookie so there is no flash. Values: `dark` | `paper` | `system`.
- **`Assist`** — the AI panel, lazy-loaded (`AssistLazy`). Talks to `api/assist`.
- **`FlipRow`** — a shared three-tile split-flap row. **Currently imported by nothing**; the
  `StatTile` change covered the screens that needed it. Use it or delete it, do not leave it as a
  third way to do the same thing.

## Before you edit

- **The sidebar is not the permission system.** Hiding a link does not protect a route; the RPC
  behind it does its own check. Never rely on the nav for access control.
- **Do not add a screen without adding it to `MODULES_BY_TYPE` and `ROLE_ACCESS`.** A route with no
  module entry is reachable by URL and invisible in the nav, which is the worst of both.
- **`ALWAYS_ON` bypasses the master's enabled set.** Adding to it is a product decision.
- **`.ink-panel` deliberately sets no `position`** — an unlayered rule here would beat Tailwind's
  `.sticky` and unstick the sidebar.
- **The rail range lives in one media query** (`768px`–`1279.98px`) and the hamburger is drawn by
  CSS (`.rail-only`), not by JavaScript — move the breakpoint there, and only there.
- **The spacer must stay the aside's next sibling** (`aside[data-open] + .nav-spacer`). Put anything
  between them and opening the drawer slides the page 76px left.
- **Inside the app the body is the frame's dark (`body:has(.deck-card)`), in both themes.** Left at
  the theme's page colour (#ecece7 in paper), iPad Safari showed it as a light band under the card
  whenever its toolbar collapsed and the screen grew past the frame's `min-h-dvh`. Headless Chrome
  never reproduces this — its viewport does not change mid-scroll — so test it by forcing the body
  taller than the frame (`below.mjs`) rather than by looking for a gap.
- **The theme cookie is read in `<head>`.** Anything that decides layout from the theme must be CSS,
  not JavaScript, or it flashes.

## Verify

```
node dashcheck.mjs       # the shell is on every page it measures
node toolbars.mjs        # 24 checks across six screens
node nav.mjs             # 834/1024/1194/1279: icon rail, 44px hamburger, opens over the page
                         # without moving it, Esc / scrim / picking a screen close it;
                         # 1280/1440: full menu, no hamburger; 412: bottom bar
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build
```

Sign in as a non-owner on a demo property and confirm the sidebar matches the ticks.
